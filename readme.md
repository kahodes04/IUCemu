# IUCemu

IUCemu is an application that will install and update Cemu alongside the Cemu Hook plugin.

## How to use

First download the executable and place it in an empty folder in which you wish to install the emulator. If the emulator is already installed, place the executable inside the root of it where "cemu.exe" is found. It is important that you do not rename "cemu.exe", otherwise it would affect the functionality of this tool. After this is done, to install the emulator just open the file. It will download all the files needed including the plugin Cemu Hook. It should take a few seconds depending on the internet speed. Afterwards clicking on this tool will update the emulator should there be a new version to be downloaded. Remember not to rename "Cemu.exe" if you wish to update the emulator.
